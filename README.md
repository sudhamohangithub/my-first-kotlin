## What is Kotlin?
  Kotlin is an open source programming language developed by JetBrain.

## What is fetures of Kotlin?
Google has adapted Kotlin as official development language for Android app. 

## Why Kotlin?
- No more null pointer exception. 
- less boilerplate code 
    - class is not needed for function/method
    - ; not needed
    - Variable type declaration is not needed if assigning value. 
    - println is sufficient (no need of System.out)
- Immutable variabls and Immutable collecetion type
- Functional Programming - better then lamda
- Function can be outside of class, called as top level function, by default public and static.

## What you can not
- you will not able to use lombok

## Point to remember
- All the variable that you pass to constructor is val
- Secondary constructor must call primary constructor 
- companion object
- data classes
  - destructuring 
- ternary operator not possible in kotlin, use return if 

## Best Praticess
Prefer immutable variable val 
Avoid non-null oerator !!
